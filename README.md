L5-Haskell
==========

A Compiler for the L5 Language written in Haskell

More info to come later.

Todo:

 - [ ] Add Linux backend for L1 (requires refactoring to allow multiple L1 backends)
 - [ ] Finish L4
 - [ ] Finish L5
 - [ ] Add more built in data types
 - [ ] Add L6 - A Language to allow user defined data types
 - [ ] Refactor label and temporary var code because it's all over the place and nasty
